Cadence README
==============

<Introduction stuff>


Quick Installation
------------------

Cadence should (mostly) work out of the box - all you need to do is configure
your server and a few settings to get a basic setup running. Basic instructions
are covered here, but if you're doing something more complex (e.g. integrating
Cadence into an existing site) you should consult the full documentation for
more extensive setup instructions. Actually, you should probably do that
anyways (especially before asking questions if/when something goes wrong), but
if you're the type of person who throws away the manual as soon as he opens the
box these should get you started quickly.

<INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS WILL GO HERE WHEN I FIGURE THEM OUT>
